Linear Regression, LogisticRegression : recursion&amp;Gradient Descent Scala 3.3.1 code, IntelliJ Platform
(I have also included some documents (.docx) concerning linear and logistic regression)
This code runs using basic Scala 3.3.1
I am using IntelliJ 2023.2.2 .. For a *new project* use:  
Scala 3.3.1,  JDK Java 8 latest version , sbt latest version.
For  scala 3.3.1 , IntelliJ creates the **build.sbt** file  for you,so no need to edit it.
( I have included it however for reference)

**recurseSum.sc** ( an interactive program to get up tLogRego speed on recursion ( used in the rest of the project(s)

**LinRegRecurseModA** uses gradient descent and  tail recursion to work out the "w", "b" parameters for a homework data set.
**LogRegGDTest.scala** uses gradient descent and tail recursion to work ou the "w" ,"b" for the Hosmer dataset

These code files should run inside any IDE that supports Scala 3.3.1 and sbt, including metals.
